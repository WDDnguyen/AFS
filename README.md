# AFS - Automated Farming System 
## McGill University ECSE 456/457 Design Project 

Currently in development
This prototype components will be controlled by an Arduino Uno microcontroller using C/C++.

### Description
AFS is designed as a small scale system that can provide a sustainable source of food autonomously with the only human interaction being for resupplying/maintenance. This small scale model is used to mimic a full scale model where it would be able to be deployed in areas deemed unsuitable for vegeration to grow in and that can efficiently provide local small communities in remote locations with a sustainable food source.
